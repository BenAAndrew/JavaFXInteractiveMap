# JavaFXInteractiveMap

An application to generate a virtual browser through JavaFX and control the page calling javascript commands from java.

We implemented this with a leap motion controller (code included) to allow a google map to be controlled by hand movements and projected onto a table. Can also use overlays to add images over a page.

Includes leap motion lib (only needed if using leap motion controller). All code in this folder belongs to Leap Motion and can be downloaded in the SDK too.

Please contact me if you want to implement this for a cool project (is actually quite easy)

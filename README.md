# JavaFXInteractiveMap

An application to generate a virtual browser through JavaFX and control the page calling javascript commands from java.

We implemented this with a leap motion controller (code included) to allow a google map to be controlled by hand movements.

Please contact me if you want to implement this for a cool project (is actually quite easy)
